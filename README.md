## How This GitHub Is Organized

Projects are grouped by year. Tools I actually use live in [personal-software](https://github.com/sasha-computer/personal-software). Quick experiments and throwaway scripts go in [experiments](https://github.com/sasha-computer/experiments).

| Repo | What's in there |
|------|----------------|
| [2026](https://github.com/sasha-computer/2026) | zkVM debug tooling, AI agents, trip planners, spaced repetition |
| [2025](https://github.com/sasha-computer/2025) | ZK in the browser, 3D puzzle games, neural nets from scratch |
| [2024](https://github.com/sasha-computer/2024) | Tezos faucets, ZK proofs, Steel programs |
| [2023](https://github.com/sasha-computer/2023) | :) |
| [2022](https://github.com/sasha-computer/2022) | Solidity bootcamp, account abstraction, NFT warranties |
| [2021](https://github.com/sasha-computer/2021) | Crypto fundamentals. ECDSA, Merkle trees |

## Highlights

- 🔭 **[Argus](https://github.com/sasha-computer/2026/tree/main/argus)** - Debug tool for Boundless proof requests. Fetches from BoundlessMarket on Base, runs guest programs locally in the RISC Zero zkVM. Rust + Nix.
